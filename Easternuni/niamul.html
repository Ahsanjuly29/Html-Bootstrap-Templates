					<p>The Academic System of Eastern University comprises Programs, Courses, Credit hours, Semesters, Continuous Evaluation and Alphabetical Grading. Each component is described below: </p>
					<h3>Programs:</h3>
					<p>The University offers undergraduate and graduate programs. At present, the following programs are offered:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Undergraduate:</li> 
						<ul>
							<li>B.A. (Hons.) in English</li>
							<li> BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration)</li>
							<li>B.Sc. in CSE (Computer Science & Engineering) </li>
							<li>B.Sc. in EEE (Electric & Electronic Engineering) </li>
							<li>B.Sc. in ETE (Electronic & Telecommunication Engineering) </li>
							<li> LL.B. (Hons.) </li>
						</ul>
						<li>Graduate programs:</li> 
						<ul>
							<li>LL.M</li>
							<li>M.A. in ELT (English Language Teaching) 2- year</li>
							<li>M.A. in ELT (English Language Teaching) 1- year </li>
							<li>M.A in English Language & Literature (ELL) </li>
							<li>MBA (Regular) </li>
							<li>MBA (Executive) </li>
						</ul>
					</ol>
					<p>The curriculum of the respective program provides a list of courses and other details.</p>
					
					<h3>Courses</h3>
					<p>Each program consists of a number of courses. For example, BBA Program consists of 45 courses. Each course is identified by a course number and course title. The course number consists of two parts - an alphabetical part followed by a three digit number.  For example,   ENG 107 Reading and Grammar is a course in English, compulsory for all EU students. The three alphabets preceding the number indicate the prime area of the course. In the example, ENG stands for English. The first digit of the three numbers refers to the level of the course - higher the number, higher is the level of the course. For example, CSE 293 Object-Oriented Programming is a higher level course than CSE 163 Programming (C). CSE 475 Software Engineering is yet a higher level course compared to CSE 293. The second and third digits refer to the serial number of the course. The course levels and the list of courses are shown in the Semester and Course Sequence Table of each program. The students of each undergraduate program fall into four levels. Each level is determined by the credit hours completed by a student. </p>
					
					<h3>Credit Hours</h3>
					<p>3.1 Each course carries certain weights indicated by credit hours.  Courses may carry different credit hours. A course may be of 1 credit hour, 2 credit hours, 3 credit hours or even 4 or 6 credit hours. For example, ENG 107 is a 2 credit hours course and LAW 440 carries 4 credit hours.  Most courses in Eastern University are however of three credit hours.</p>
					<p>3.2 A one credit hour course is equal to at least 13 classroom contact hours and a three credit hours course for at least 40 contact hours in class during the semester. Depending upon the need for frequency of meeting, a three credit hours course may have thrice-a-week contact for 60 minutes in each class or it may have twice-a-week contact for 90 minutes in each class.</p>			
					<p>3.3 In addition to lecture classes, a course may have tutorial/workshop sessions or laboratory course/sessional. A Tutorial or Workshop is for facilitating the learning of the students by practice through working out exercises, solving problems, showing application of the concepts and theories etc.  Such a session for a course usually has a 90 minutes contact every week or every alternate week (depending upon the need) and does not carry additional credit hours. However, a Lab course or Sessional carries additional credit hours - usually one credit and has at least 90 minutes contact every week depending upon the nature of the course. For example, CSE 163 Programming (C) - a 3 credit hours theory course -   is followed by a one credit hour course CSE 164 Programming (C) Sessional. </p>	
					<div class="semester">
						<h3>Semester</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>The academic year of Eastern University comprises three semesters:</li>
							<ul class="py-3">
								<li><b>Spring Semester: January - April</b></li>
								<li><b>Summer Semester: May - August</b></li>
								<li><b>Fall Semester: September- December</b></li>
							</ul>
							<li>The duration of each semester is 15 weeks - 13 weeks for classes and 2 weeks for midterm examinations, recess and final examinations. An additional week is needed for script examination and grading, and for processing and publication of results.</li>
						</ol>

						<h3>Continuous Evaluation</h3>
						<p>The performance of the students is measured and evaluated throughout the semester. Evaluation methods during the semester include quizzes, class tests, class/home assignments, exercises, case analysis and reporting, one or two mid-term exams, etc. End of the semester evaluation include final exam, term papers, project report, thesis, etc. </p>			
					
						<h3>Grading</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>The numerical scores earned by a student in the quizzes, tests, exams etc. as mentioned above during and at the end of the semester are cumulated and are assigned a letter grade as follows:</li>
							<table class="table table-borderless">
								<thead>
									<tr>
										<th>Score</th>
										<th>Grade</th>
										<th>Points</th>
										<th> </th>
										<th> </th>
										<th> </th>
										<th> </th>
										<th> </th>
										<th> </th>
										<th> </th>
										<th> </th>
										<th> </th>
									</tr>
								</thead>
								<tbody>
									<tr>
										<td>80% & above</td>
										<td>A+</td>
										<td>4.00</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>65% to less than 70%</td>
										<td>B+</td>
										<td>3.25</td>										
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>40% to less than 45%</td>
										<td>D</td>
										<td>2.00</td>
										
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>Less than 40%</td>
										<td>F</td>
										<td>0.00</td>
									</tr>
								</tbody>
							</table>
							<li>The Eastern University uses the following abbreviations to denote status of grading process:
								<ul>
									<li>W Withdrawal </li>
									<li>I Incomplete </li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Withdrawn (W) is assigned to a student who withdraws from the course within the deadline. A student who withdraws after this date will earn the grade based on his/her performance before his/her withdrawal. Exception to this rule may be made on medical ground and on terms and conditions imposed by the university.</li>
							<li>Incomplete Grade (I): An Incomplete (I) grade is assigned only when a student has failed to complete one or more requirements of the course for an unavoidable reason/accidental circumstance and the application for "I" has been accepted by the course teacher.</li>
							<li>Retaken (R) is assigned to a course which a student has taken for improvement of grade.</li>
